just some general data exploration and practice using CTEs and temp tables using global covid data provided by "https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths" anything gathered beyond the posting of the initial commit will be slightly different.

There is a second excel table dealing with covid vaccination records that was a bit larger than expected, I'll be happy to provide the data I used but that will change
day by day as the data is updated on the official website each day
