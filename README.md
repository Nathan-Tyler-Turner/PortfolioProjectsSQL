# PortfolioProjectsSQL

There will be multiple SQL examples within this directory. Each name for the file should give you a general idea of what goes on within the code. I will provide what datasets I used as well as  also try to provide some descriptions here to help expedite searches if anyone is looking for anything in particular.

The NashvilleHousingDataCleaning file is just some general data on the Nashville area housing market, and is meant to demonstrate general data cleaning practices from standardizing date formats, populating blank fields with the correct information, removing duplicate data, seperating information from a single column and placing seperate parts in their own unique columns. Each section of code has comments for what it does. 

 The Covid Portfolio Project is just some general data exploration and practice using CTEs and temp tables using global covid data provided by "https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths" anything gathered beyond the posting of the initial commit will be slightly different.

There is a second excel table dealing with covid vaccination records that was a bit larger than expected, I'll be happy to provide the data I used but that will change
day by day as the data is updated on the official website each day
